## üî¶ Project Spotlight
### Hardware Interaction
### [![IT Lablights](https://img.shields.io/badge/IT%20LABLIGHTS-black.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/SeanMcKeen/IT-Lablights) 
##### This project is perhaps my most ambitious yet, it was the first project I made using the C++ language and served as my introduction into hardware programming. I haven't had time to complete my rewrite of it, but the main branch contains semi-functional (though unoptimized) code.

### Utility Tools
### [![Rarities](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rarities-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)](https://github.com/SeanMcKeen/Rarities)
##### Simple python script to simulate different rarites based on the percent occurance. (Essentially a 'Legendary' rarity set to be 1% will only occur at a 1% chance)
### [![Decrapify](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Decrapify-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows11&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/SeanMcKeen/Decrapify)
##### Another simple script I made while working at an IT helpdesk imaging new laptops, simply removes unnecessary bloatware, if you have any suggestions please let me know, finding package names is a pain.
